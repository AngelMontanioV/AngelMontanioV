- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AngelMontanioV
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in understanding how things work from different perspectives, from code to the architecture being employed. I enjoy observing how the pieces come together and create something increasingly larger. I am particularly interested in software scalability and its implications.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am focused on expanding my skills and knowledge in web application development. I am dedicating time to learn and work with technologies like Spring Boot, Hibernate, and JPA.
